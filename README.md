# Virtual Keyboard

Bilingual virtual keyboard with typed text output

## My role

Ð¡reated the design and developed the application according to all the functional and technical requirements.

## Stack

- vanilla JavaScript with OOP approach
- SCSS
- BEM
- Eslint with Airbnb config
- Webpack

## Functional requirements:

Example:
![screenshot](img/posts/virtual-keyboard/reference.png)

- design is at your discretion.
- pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard
- there may be differences in keystrokes on different operating systems (Windows, macOS). To avoid mistakes, it's necessary to specify in which OS the virtual keyboard was created
- if several buttons are pressed, all the pressed buttons are highlighted on the virtual keyboard (there're no exceptions for `Ctrl`, `Alt` and `Shift` as well)
- the virtual keyboard is able to switch between two language layouts (English + any other language).
  - assigning a keyboard shortcut for switching keyboard layout is up to you
  - the buttons on the virtual keyboard display symbols of a selected language
  - the application saves a chosen language after the page is reloaded and displays the keyboard on that language
  - the keyboard shortcut for changing language should be indicated on the page so that it will be clear for a user how to switch keyboard layout
- keystrokes are animated
- clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard should input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard
  - pressing the `Up`, `Down`, `Left` or `Right` arrow key inputs an arrow symbol in the input field, or implements navigation on the text area.
  - pressing the `Enter` should move a text cursor to the next line
  - the `Tab` key creates a horizontal indent
  - pressing the rest of the function keys on a keyboard does not result in inputting symbols
  - the `Backspace` key removes character before the text cursor
  - the `Del` key removes character after the text cursor
  - the `Shift`, `Alt`, `Ctrl`, `Caps lock` and `Space` keys should work as on a real keyboard

## Technical requirements

- `index.html` file should be empty (all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS)
- should work on the latest Chrome version
- usage of JQuery and other JS libraries is **not allowed**
- usage of Bootstrap and other UI libraries is **not allowed**
- usage of Angular/React/Vue and other frameworks is **not allowed**
- you can use CSS preprocessors
- <a href='https://eslint.org' target='_blank'>ESLint (eslint-config-airbnb-base)</a> should be used
